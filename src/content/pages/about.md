      ## Manifesto


      Disenchanted with the evolution of the digital scenery, immediateness and
      producing for the sake of producing, I started to look for alternatives
      within the world of photography.


      In 2013 I got my first 35mm camera and shot my first film. Since then, I
      have been immersed in chemical photography and some mixed techniques.


      I do not despise digital, I simply find my place in processes that allow
      me to reflect more carefully. My life project is to explore new
      possibilities or remember other ways of doing things, and enjoy the
      process.

      teenager. Skateboarding and underground music, like hardcore punk, allowed
      him to grow as a creator and observe the world in a unique way.

      Multiplatform and Web Application Development through the Universitat
      Oberta de Catalunya (Open University of Catalonia).
